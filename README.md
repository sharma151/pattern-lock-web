As you might be aware that it's a pretty popular feature on Android devices to have a pattern lock. You can set a pattern lock for your device which gets unlocked only by matching it again. I've tried to replicate the same for the web, so that we can have fun for some time. This can as well be used to authenticate your website users as it's a all a number game behind the scenes.

Will be updating it to make a full fledged challenging social game going forward.

As of now, you can do following tasks
=====================================
Create an Unlock pattern on the grid

Once the pattern is drawn, click on "Set Pattern"

Now it's time to Unlock, you have to enter the same pattern to unlock it

Upon successfully matching the pattern, you see a green tick mark
